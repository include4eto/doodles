_cool stuff that doesn't belong anywhere else_

All of these are cool little things I've written over the years that don't
really deserve their own repository. Instead, I've put them all in a page with
an iframe. Now, if you're wondering why this is on github, well, I've linked it
to my CV and I'm yet to sort my hosting out. Plus they're cool.
